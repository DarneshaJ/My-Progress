<h2 >Bio</h2>

<p>I am a <b> QUICK LEARNER </b>, and I <i> LOVE </i> chocolate. I also <i> LOVE</i> <del>beets</del> mangos. My <strong> children</strong> are my driving <mark>force</mark>. Eveything that I do is for their future and betterment. I am also a very silly, yet intelligent woman. I believe that a sense of humor is detrimental to survival. I work hard, I have survived much, and I'm always ready for an adventure. I love AHBAH, my family, anime, animals, nature, and all things sparkly (I am a girl after all). <i class="fas fa-gem"></i>

<p>This is the very first webpage that I have ever created. I am excited to work on it and learn as I do so. I will be updating it periodically, as I learn new techniques. As you can see, I have learned to utilize functions such as <b>BOLD TEXT</b>, <i>Italic text</i>, <del>crossed out text</del>, <strong>strong text</strong>, and <mark>highlighted text</mark>. I have also learned how to add a banner, as shown by my ever so pretty unicorns. I had displayed the knowledge of how to add jelly buttons, highlighted links, multiple pages and the knowledgeof how to edit the text, look and feel of my page. I will be adding more skills as I aquire them. </p>

<h3>Social Media</h3>
<div class="icon">
<i class="fab fa-facebook-f"></i>
</div>
<p>I have not yet learned anything in the Social Media field, except that whatever you put on social media, stays on social media. I will update this as I learn more.</p>

    <h3>Information</h3>

    <p>I will not be adding an abundant amount of infor mation on myself, as this page is purely to demonstrate my skills and abilities at building a webpage. I will update this page as I learn more.
